Hopefully you've gone through the Tutorial, and created some Terms.

From the Tutorial, you've already told Lute that you know most of the words on this page, but there are still a few blue words.  Again according to Lute, these are "unknown".

(fyi - If a text has a spelling mikstaske, you can edit it by clicking the small Edit icon next to the title.  If you'd like, correct the mistake now, and resave this text.)

You'll see the definitions of of words that you told Lute in the Tutorial, such as for the Terms elephant and dogs -- hover over them to see some information.

That's the core feature of Lute!  There are some sample stories for other languages.  Try those out or create your own.

When you're done with the demo, update your local environment file with a new database name, and go back to the Home screen.  Lute will create a new empty database for you, and you can get started.

I hope that you find Lute a fun tool to use for learning languages.  Learning by reading really is the cat's pyjamas.

Cheers and best wishes!
