Hopefully you've gone through the Tutorial, and created some Terms.

From the Tutorial, you've already told Lute that you know most of the words on this page.  You can hover over words to see information about them, such as your information you might have added about dogs.

There are still a few blue words, which according to Lute are still "unknown" to you.  You can process them like you did on the last text.

(fyi - If a text has a spelling mikstaske, you can edit it by clicking the small Edit icon next to the title.  If you'd like, correct the mistake now, and resave this text.)

That's the core feature of Lute!  There are some sample stories for other languages.  Try those out or create your own.

When you're done with the demo, update your local environment file with a new database name, and go back to the Home screen.  Lute will create a new empty database for you, and you can get started.

I hope that you find Lute a fun tool to use for learning languages.

Cheers and best wishes!
