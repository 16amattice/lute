# LUTE - Learning Using Texts

This is a fork and ground-up rewrite of [Hugo Fara's fork](https://github.com/hugofara) of the original Learning with Texts project on [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/learning-with-texts).

> Lute would never have existed without the original Learning With Texts and Hugo Fara's subsequent efforts, so **a big thanks to both of these projects.**

* If you're wondering whether you should use Lute or something else, [here's my take](./docs/lute_and_alternatives.md).
* If you're into tech, and wonder why I created a new project rather than improve the existing LWT code, see [why I forked](./docs/why_the_fork.md).
* [Installation](./docs/installation.md)

There's more notes in [the docs](./docs/README.md).

If you're a user: Lute is free :-) ... but if it makes your life better and you feel like saying thanks, I gladly accept <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jzohrab" target="_blank">coffee</a>.  I'll give thanks and will use the caffeine to implement features, or, better, recruit devs to grow the project.
