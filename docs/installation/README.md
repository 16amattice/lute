# Installation

Installation can be daunting, so here are some notes.

* [Installing on MAMP](./install_mamp.md)
* If you're more technical, and are setting up your own Apache/Php/MySQL stack instead of using a pre-packaged thing like MAMP/XAMP/Whatever, I'll assume you can get that rolling, but here are some quick notes for [installing on plain Apache](./install_apache.md).

I find Apache configuration daunting as well, so here are some [actual apache config files](./sample_apache_config_files/README.md) as I use them on my personal machine.  These are for reference only, but maybe they will help someone.
